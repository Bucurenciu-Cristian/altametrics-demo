# altametrics-demo
In this repo I'll showcase my development skills.

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the project directory
3. Run docker-compose up --build

---
That's it. 

## What's included
 - 

- 3 services: frontend, backend, and database
- Frontend: React
- Backend: NestJS
  - Swagger: /api 
    - You can test the API from the swagger UI
- Database: Postgres

PS: I know it's not the perfect way of doing it with docker-compose, but it gets the job done.

### Running the project
